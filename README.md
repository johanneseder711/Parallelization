# Overview

Personal project on understanding mulit threading and multi processing based on Python. \
The idea for this is based on the following [Medium Post](https://towardsdatascience.com/multithreading-multiprocessing-python-180d0975ab29). \

The tests for the scripts have been made on the MacBook Pro (14", 2021) using the Apple M1 Pro with 8 CPU Kernels.
